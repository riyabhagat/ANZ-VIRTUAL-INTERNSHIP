Using the same transaction dataset, identify the annual salary for each customer
Explore correlations between annual salary and various customer attributes (e.g. age). 
These attributes could be those that are readily available in the data (e.g. age) or those that you construct or derive yourself (e.g. those relating to purchasing behaviour). 
Visualise any interesting correlations using a scatter plot.
Build a simple regression model to predict the annual salary for each customer using the attributes you identified above
